## Logbook

### 5 feb 2016

I decided to create this playful application for children on a cold Saturday.
I'm thinking about it for a while. My idea at this time is to create a simple
color book for small children (mine are 2 and 4 years old). I would like to
make it available in the open for any parent artists to be able to submit
stroke SVG to be colorized. Not sure I will reach this state but anyway, let's
start. My objective for this first session is to bootstrap a react application
and to deploy it.

I used the nice getting started guide from [Christian Alfoni](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/Getting-started.html) to bootstrap a
working environment.
